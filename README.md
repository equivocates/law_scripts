# Law Scripts

## Bluebook Case Names
This script takes in text and abbreviates it per bluebook. Also, it stupidly capitalizes every word in the case name except for predesignated prepositions, conjunctions, and articles. Then, it returns it to system out via the print function. This is meant to be used as a service in macOS.
